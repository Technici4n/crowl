Rust voxel engine and game.

Implementation of https://github.com/Technici4n/rust-voxel-game.

## Contributing
If you are interested in contributing, the best you can do for now is review the (most probably awful) code or improve and add 32x32 textures. They are going to be useful at some point.
You can also discuss the design of the engine at https://github.com/Technici4n/rust-voxel-game.
